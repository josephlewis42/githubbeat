githubbeat:
  # Defines how often an event is sent to the output
  period: 1h
  # Should the first collection happen immediately after plugin start?
  # if false, the duration defined by period will elapse first.
  start_immediately: true
  # Defines how much time a fetch should at most take
  job_timeout: 10s
  # List of individual repositories to watch
  # Expected format is [owner]/[repo]

      - elastic/beats
  # List of individual organizations to watch.
  # WARNING, enabling these may quickly consume your quota.

  # Enterprise attributes allow special functions for those running GitHub enterprise.
  
  # The base URL of the API.
  # Leave this blank if you want to connect to GitHub.com

  # The following are attributes that will make additional API calls for each repository.
  # The `enabled` property authorizes the extra API call(s).
  # If the attribute is a list it will automatically include a count of the elements in the list.
  # If you enable the .list option it will also dump out the contents of the list.
  #
  # The max attribute applies to attributes which make paged (possibly more than one) API calls.
  # Max is the maximum number of _elements_ you want to fetch (not pages).
  # The actual number returned is rounded to the nearest page e.g. if you set 15 items max, but
  # GitHub uses pages of size 10, you'll get 20 items.
  # The beat uses Github's default page sizes.
  # A value of -1 means to fetch all pages.

  # Should we enable counting forks? By default this is off because it's part of the basic
  # repository information.
